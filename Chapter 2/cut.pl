% % % The ! (cut) is used to stop Prolog from backtracking once the condition is met (when the answer is yes).

% % The cut (!) is a special predicate in Prolog that is used to stop backtracking. When Prolog encounters a cut in the code, it prevents further backtracking past that point, meaning Prolog will not reconsider alternative solutions for the predicates before the cut.

% % Simple Example Using Cut:
% % Let’s say you are defining a rule for checking whether a person is an adult or a child, and you want to stop Prolog from looking for alternative solutions once it has found a valid answer.

age(john, 20).
age(mary, 16).
age(susan, 25).

is_adult(Person) :-
    age(Person, Age),
    Age >= 18,  % If the person is 18 or older, they are an adult
    !.         % Cut to prevent backtracking

is_adult(Person) :-
    age(Person, Age),
    Age < 18.  % Otherwise, the person is a child

% % Explanation of How the Cut Works:
% % Without the cut (!): If you query is_adult(john), Prolog will first check if john is 18 or older (which is true). If there is no cut, Prolog would continue searching for more solutions, even though there is no other possible rule or solution for john. It might still attempt to go down the second is_adult rule.
    
% % With the cut (!): When Prolog encounters the cut after checking the age condition (Age >= 18), it will stop looking for further solutions once it finds the first one. This optimizes the process and avoids unnecessary backtracking

% Query Example:
% ?- is_adult(john).
% Result:
% Prolog will find that john is 20, which satisfies the first rule (Age >= 18), and then it will cut and return true, without considering the second rule.

% ?- is_adult(mary).
% Result:
% Prolog will find that mary is 16, so it will go to the second rule (Age < 18) and return true as well.

% Why the Cut is Important:
% Without the cut, Prolog would try to find all possible solutions by backtracking to the second is_adult rule (even if it’s unnecessary).
% The cut (!) is used to stop Prolog from searching further once it has found a valid solution, improving efficiency.

% Summary:
% The cut (!) is used to prevent backtracking after Prolog has found a valid solution.
% In the example above, once Prolog finds that john is an adult (18 or older), it stops searching and doesn't re-check the second rule.
