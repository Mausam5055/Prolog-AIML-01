% In Prolog, the repeat predicate is used to create an infinite loop that can generate multiple solutions. It always succeeds (i.e., it doesn't fail), and Prolog will backtrack to it if necessary, allowing it to keep trying different solutions. You often use repeat when you want to repeatedly execute certain goals or generate multiple solutions in a controlled way.

% Key Characteristics of repeat:

% Always succeeds: repeat never fails on its own, which makes it useful for creating loops or iterating over tasks.

% Causes backtracking: After executing the goals following repeat, Prolog will backtrack to repeat to try again, unless a stopping condition (like fail) is encountered.

repeat,
    [some_goal].

% The goal (or series of goals) will keep executing as long as Prolog backtracks to repeat.

% Example 1: Infinite Loop with repeat
% Let's look at a simple example where repeat is used to create an infinite loop that asks the user for input repeatedly:

ask_question :-
    repeat,
    write('Do you want to continue? (yes/no): '),
    read(Answer),
    (Answer == yes -> true; fail).

% repeat: Starts an infinite loop.

% write and read: Ask the user to input a response.
% (Answer == yes -> true; fail): If the user types yes, the loop continues, but if the user types anything else (like no), fail is called, and Prolog exits the loop.

% When you run this query, Prolog will repeatedly ask the question until the user enters something other than yes.

% Load the Prolog File: Once you're in the Prolog shell, load your Prolog file with the following command:
% ?- [ask_question].

% Run the ask_question Predicate: Now, you can run the ask_question predicate by entering: 

% ?- ask_question.
% Interaction in the Terminal:

% Once you run ask_question, it will prompt you to enter "yes" or "no". Hereâ€™s an example of what the terminal interaction would look like:
% ?- ask_question.

% Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes
% Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes
% Do you want to continue? (yes/no): no.

% How it Works:
% The Prolog program keeps asking "Do you want to continue? (yes/no):" because of the repeat predicate.

% If you type yes, it will ask again.
% If you type no, the program will stop because of the fail predicate, which causes Prolog to exit the loop.

% Notes:
% Ctrl+C: If you want to stop the loop manually, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal to interrupt Prolog.
