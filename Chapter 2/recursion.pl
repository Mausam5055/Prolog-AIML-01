% Recursion in Prolog is a way of solving problems where a rule or function calls itself with a simpler or smaller version of the original problem. Instead of using traditional loops like for or while, Prolog relies on recursion to break down a task into smaller parts until it reaches a base case, which stops the process.

% Simple Explanation of Recursion in Prolog:
% Base Case: This is the simplest version of the problem, which can be solved directly. It acts as the stopping condition for the recursion.

% Recursive Case: This is where the function or rule calls itself to solve a smaller version of the problem, moving towards the base case.

% Example:
% Let’s say you want to find the sum of numbers from 1 to N. Here’s how recursion works:

% Base Case: If N is 0, the sum is 0 (you don’t add anything).
% Recursive Case: For any number N > 0, the sum is N + sum(N-1) (i.e., the sum of numbers from 1 to N is N plus the sum of numbers from 1 to N-1).

% Code Example: Summing Numbers
% % Base case: 
% If N is 0, the sum is 0
% sum(0, 0).

% % Recursive case: 
% Sum of numbers from N is N + sum(N-1)
% sum(N, Sum) :-
%     N > 0,           % N should be positive
%     N1 is N - 1,     % Decrease N by 1
%     sum(N1, Sum1),   % Recursively calculate sum(N-1)
%     Sum is N + Sum1. % Add N to the result of sum(N-1)

% How Recursion Works:
% When you query sum(3, Sum):

% Step 1: sum(3, Sum) checks the rule. It calls sum(2, Sum1) and adds 3.
% Step 2: sum(2, Sum1) calls sum(1, Sum2) and adds 2.
% Step 3: sum(1, Sum2) calls sum(0, Sum3) and adds 1.
% Step 4: sum(0, Sum3) hits the base case and returns 0.
% Now, Prolog works backward:
% sum(1, Sum2) becomes 1 + 0 = 1.
% sum(2, Sum1) becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
% sum(3, Sum) becomes 3 + 3 = 6.
% So, the sum of numbers from 1 to 3 is 6.

% Why Use Recursion in Prolog?

% Natural fit: Prolog is designed around rules and relationships. Recursion fits naturally into this way of thinking.

% No loops: Instead of looping through numbers or lists, Prolog handles the repetition by calling itself with smaller tasks until it reaches a solution.

% In essence, recursion is a powerful tool in Prolog that allows the language to "repeat" tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts until it reaches a simple case that can be solved directly.
