## Course Overview

In this repository, we‚Äôll cover the following topics:

- Introduction to Prolog
- Facts and Rules
- Queries in Prolog
- Variables and Unification
- Lists in Prolog
- Recursion in Prolog
- Prolog's Backtracking Mechanism
- Advanced Topics (e.g., Cut, Negation)

Each section contains code examples and exercises to help you learn and practice Prolog in a hands-on way.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (any language like Python, C, or Java)
- A logical mindset and an understanding of basic logic principles
- No prior Prolog experience is required!

---

## Installation

### 1. Install a Prolog interpreter

To run Prolog code, you'll need a Prolog interpreter. You can use **SWI-Prolog**, a popular and free implementation of Prolog.

- **SWI-Prolog**: [Download here](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

After installation, you can start the interpreter by typing `swipl` in your terminal or command prompt.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prolog-basics.git
```

### 3. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd prolog-basics
```

You can now open the Prolog files in your preferred text editor or directly in SWI-Prolog.

## Code Examples

Here are some basic examples to get you started with Prolog.

### 1. Introduction to Facts and Rules (intro.pl)

```prolog
% Facts
likes(john, pizza).
likes(jane, pasta).
likes(john, pasta).

% Rules
loves(X, Y) :- likes(X, Y), likes(Y, X).

% Queries
% ?- likes(john, pizza).   % True
% ?- loves(john, jane).    % True, because both like each other
```

#### Running the example:
1. Open the `intro.pl` file in SWI-Prolog.
2. Run a query by typing it into the Prolog prompt.

---

### 2. Working with Queries (queries.pl)

```prolog
% Facts
father(john, jim).
father(jim, tom).

% Queries
% ?- father(john, X).  % Returns X = jim
% ?- father(jim, X).   % Returns X = tom
```

#### Explanation:
Prolog can return variables based on facts and queries. In this case, `X` will be bound to the values that satisfy the query.

---

### 3. Variables and Unification (variables_unification.pl)

```prolog
% Facts
father(john, jim).
father(jim, tom).

% Queries
% ?- father(X, jim).   % Returns X = john
% ?- father(jim, X).   % Returns X = tom
```

#### Explanation:
Unification in Prolog means matching variables with facts in the database. It automatically "binds" values to variables to make the query true.

---

### 4. Lists in Prolog (lists.pl)

```prolog
% List facts
member(X, [X|_]).  % Head of the list
member(X, [_|Tail]) :- member(X, Tail).  % Tail of the list

% Queries
% ?- member(john, [jim, john, alice]).  % True
% ?- member(tom, [jim, john, alice]).   % False
```

#### Explanation:
In Prolog, lists are a fundamental data structure. The `member/2` predicate checks if an element is part of the list.

---

### 5. Recursion in Prolog (recursion.pl)

```prolog
% Factorial
factorial(0, 1).  % Base case
factorial(N, Result) :- N > 0, N1 is N - 1, factorial(N1, Result1), Result is N * Result1.

% Queries
% ?- factorial(5, X).  % X = 120
```

#### Explanation:
Recursion is commonly used in Prolog to break problems down into smaller subproblems, such as computing factorials.

---

## Exercises

Here are some exercises to test your understanding and practice Prolog:

1. **Write a Prolog fact to define the "sibling" relationship.** Use facts like `sibling(john, jane).`
2. **Create a rule for "ancestor" that works recursively.** Use facts like `father(john, jim).`
3. **Write a Prolog predicate that finds the length of a list.**
4. **Write a recursive predicate to reverse a list in Prolog.**
5. **Create a Prolog program that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.**
