% 1. File Naming Rules in Prolog
% Valid File Names: File names must follow the naming rules of your operating system. For example, file123.pl is valid.
% but "01_file.pl" is invalid

% Use of Special Characters: Avoid special characters (e.g., @, #, !, -, etc.) because they may confuse Prolog or the operating system.

% Enclosing in Quotes: If your file name includes numbers, spaces, or special characters, you may need to enclose it in single quotes when consulting in Prolog. For example:

% ?- consult('file123.pl').
